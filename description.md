Connect a Bleskomat ATM to an lnbits wallet.

Since the Bleskomat ATMs are designed to be offline, a cryptographic signing scheme is used to verify that the URL was generated by an authorized device. When one of your customers inserts fiat money into the device, a signed URL (lnurl-withdraw) is created and displayed as a QR code.
